# Lab - Sync Salesforce data using IBM App Connect Enterprise

In this lab you will create an App Connect flow  to push client data from the **IBM Stock Trader Lite** app to Salesforce. This will occur whenever a user of the  **IBM Stock Trader Lite** app creates a new portfolio for a new client. Basic information about the client is stored in the  **IBM Stock Trader Lite** app and more detailed info is stored in Salesforce.

The architecture of the app is shown below:

![Architecture diagram](images/architecture.png)

The **portfolio** microservice invokes the REST endpoint of the new flow whenever a new client is created and this results in a new contact being created for the new user in Salesforce.

This lab is broken up into the following sections:

1. [Sign up for Salesforce Developer Edition](#section-1-sign-up-for-salesforce-developer-edition)

  ![Security token](images/sfsectoken.png)


## Section 3: Setup connectivity to Salesforce in App Connect Designer

App Connect Designer is a component of Cloud Pak for Integration that provides an authoring environment in which you can create, test, and share flows for an API. You can share your flows by using the export and import functions, or by adding them to an Asset Repository for reuse.

3.1 In a new browser tab open the URL for **App Connect Designer**. Sign in with the credentials assigned to you by your instructors. **Note** You will be sharing the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration cluster with other students so  you will see their work  as you navigate through he tool. You will use a naming scheme for the artifacts that you create that starts with the username assigned to you by the instructors (e.g. *user005*).

3.2 Click the **Settings** icon and then select **Catalog**

   ![App Designer Catalog](images/appdesignercatalog.png)

3.3 Expand **Salesforce** .If there are existing connections shown in a drop down list  select **Add a new account ...** from that list.

   ![New Salesforce Connection](images/addanewaccount.png)

   **Note** If there are no existing connection shown click on **Connect**

3.4 Enter the following values referring to the text file from  the previous section where you saved your Salesforce credentials.

   a. For the **Login URL** enter `https://login.salesforce.com`

   b. For the **Username** enter the email you use to login to Salesforce

   c. For the **Password** enter the password you use to login to Salesforce. Then append the value of the  **Security Token**  (that you saved in the previous section) to the password. For example if your password is `foo` and your security token is `bar` you would enter `foobar` into the password field.

   d. For the **Client Id** copy and past the value of the  **Consumer Key** (that you saved in the previous section).

   e. For the **Client Secret** copy and past the value of the  **Consumer Secret** (that you saved in the previous section).
